# Roosevelt Sample App

This repo contains the default output for the latest version of the [mkroosevelt](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/mkroosevelt) app generator for [Roosevelt](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt).

Use this repo to see how the default sample app changes over time from version to version. This is useful information to know when performing upgrades from one Roosevelt version to another in your app. Or you could use this repo to make a new Roosevelt app without using the generator.
